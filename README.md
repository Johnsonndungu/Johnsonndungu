# 👋 Hey there, I'm Johnson Njenga

Welcome to my GitHub space — where ideas turn into code!

## 👀 What I'm Into  
I'm all about exploring and building cool tech. My interests include:
- Backend development with clean, scalable architecture  
- Cloud engineering & DevOps workflows  
- Automating boring stuff to make life easier  
- Exploring data and making sense of it  

## 🌱 Currently Leveling Up In  
Always learning — right now I'm diving deeper into:
- Python & Django and flask for backend magic  
- Java
- AWS & cloud-native tools for robust deployments  
- CI/CD pipelines, containers, and infrastructure as code  

## 💞️ Let’s Build Together  
I'm open to collaboration on:
- Open source projects that actually help people  
- Tools that boost developer productivity  
- Backend-heavy or cloud-first projects  
- Anything creative, clean, and purpose-driven
